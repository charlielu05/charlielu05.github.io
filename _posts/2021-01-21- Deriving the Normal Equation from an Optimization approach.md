title: Deriving the Normal Equation from an Optimization approach
---
I was watching through the lecture video about Optimization methods taught by Nando de Freitas and learnt something interesting that I'd like to share. Since I'm predominantly self taught, I've watched through many different videos about Machine Learning topics on Youtube. Nando has a rare quality of being able to distill complicated topics and explain them in a very intuitive way. I've thoroughly benefited from his materials and would highly recommend watching his video lectures on Youtube if you're interested in Machine Learning.

Back to the topic of the post. In the video I was watching, Nando was explaining the different optimization methods used for Machine Learning. What I found really interesting was that when you applied Newton's method on Linear Regression, you end up with the same form as the Maximum Likelihood Estimate solution.
